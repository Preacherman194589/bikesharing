The written analysis has the following:

Katie and I took a trip to New York to visit landmark sites. As we were there, we decided to use their Citi bike program, where we could ride a bicycle around the city and notice the site from a more personal view. Katie liked the program so much that we decided to bring the Citi bike program to Des Moines, Iowa, our hometown. 

Before introducing the program to some investors, we decided to conduct a statistical analysis concerning the program to show our investors. We used the Tableau system to come up with some visualization and expectation.  

**Results:**

Based on the analysis results, we decided to display the following. 

1.	Number of Bikes (Used & Time of Duration)

The analysis was based on usage and time. We wanted to know who would use the bikes, how long they would ride, and need the bike. Based on the graph, the average rider is no more than 20 -30 minutes.  

2.	Number of Bikes (Used by Gender)
Here we wanted to capture usage based on gender. We noticed that males rode the bike more than females, not knowing why; however, it could be based on numerous reasons.

3.	Number of Bikes (Hourly Trips & Usage of Bikes)
Based on the hourly trip and such time usage, we discovered that most riders ride their bikes between 6 am - 9 am and 5 pm – 7 pm. 

4.	Number of Bikes (Hourly Trip by Gender)
We wanted to n more about why certain gender rode the bikes over another and discovered that males ride the bike 6 am – 9 am and 4 pm – 9 pm, while females ride the bike 8 am -9 am and 5 pm -6 pm. 

5.	Number of Bikes (User type & Gender)
When looking at the customers and subscribers, we see more long-term subscribers than regular short-term customers. The next them we noticed was that males rode the bike more often, and the days of the week were Thursday and Friday, compared to the females.  

**Summary:**

Overall, the Des Moines Citi Bike Program would not just allow the citizen to explore the beautification of the city, restaurants, and retails, but it would also help the environment based on gas emission and will help to eliminate climate change. Our top priority is the safety of our riders and that they have the safest routes to get around the city. Here are two more additional visualization projects we would like to analyze to help us reach our goal. 

1.	Time of Hour (Peak Hours)
As for peak hours, with great research and analysis, we should be able to determine the peak hours and how we can better use our service due to bicycle maintenance and new locations. 

2.	Location sites 
Another area of importance is location sites. As a newly started project, we learned that the location has a big part of the company’s growth and success. We would need to conduct more research and statistical data to determine areas that are safe and long- and short-term travel from one location to another.
